                    <h2 class="mb-4">Access to the Brazilian healthcare system for immigrants</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                    <p>The Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil extends a range of fundamental rights to
                        foreign residents in the country, including the right to life (Article 5, caput, of the
                        CRFB/88). Although nothing is explicitly stated about social rights, including the right to
                        healthcare (Article 6 of the CRF/88), there have been no doubts since 2017 regarding its
                        extension to foreigners. By virtue of the principle of non-discrimination, Law 13.445/2017
                        (Migration Law) established in Article 4 that immigrants must be guaranteed, on equal terms with
                        nationals, "access to public health services and social assistance and social security, in
                        accordance with the law, without discrimination based on nationality and immigration status"
                        (Clause VIII).
                    </p>
                    <p>Regarding access to the Unified Health System (SUS), the Migration Law explicitly states that
                        there should be no discrimination based on nationality and immigration status, and that access
                        to healthcare services cannot be conditioned on migration regularization or the presentation of
                        documents. However, it should be noted that for foreigners without legal residence in the
                        country, access to SUS is limited to emergency and urgency care (emergency services), as Decree
                        No. 9.199/2017, which regulates the Migration Law, establishes the requirement of a temporary
                        visa for medical treatment, which may be granted to immigrants and their companions who can
                        prove sufficient means of subsistence (Article 35).
                    </p>
                    <p>On the other hand, Article 5 of Law No. 9.474/1997 (Refugee Law) unequivocally guarantees
                        refugees the same rights and obligations as foreigners in Brazil, which suggests that access to
                        the healthcare system should equally be ensured for this group.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, despite Law 13.445/2017 affirming the principles and guidelines of the Brazilian
                        migration policy, the universality, indivisibility, and interdependence of human rights, as well
                        as humanitarian reception, the bureaucratic difficulties in implementing the right to healthcare
                        for immigrants are not unknown.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="mb-4 mt-5">SUS Card</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        The SUS Card, also known as the National Health Card, is a document issued by the Unified Health
                        System (SUS) in Brazil. Its main objective is to facilitate citizens' access to healthcare
                        services provided by the public system.
                        With the SUS Card, users can schedule appointments, exams, surgeries, and receive free
                        medication, as well as have access to emergency services. The card is valid nationwide and can
                        be used at any healthcare facility affiliated with the SUS.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Obtaining the SUS Card is free for immigrants and refugees and can be done at
                        municipal health departments, health centers, hospitals, or SUS service units. It is necessary
                        to present an identification document, such as an RG (General Registry) or Birth Certificate,
                        and proof of residence. Having the SUS Card is not mandatory to receive healthcare services, but
                        its possession facilitates access and registration of patient information, contributing to more
                        efficient and integrated healthcare services.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Refugees in Brazil have the right to access healthcare services from the Unified Health System
                        (SUS) and, therefore, can also obtain the SUS Card. To do so, they must follow these steps:
                    </p>
                    <ul id="list">
                        <li>Registration in the National Registry of Refugees (CNR): Refugees should approach the
                            Federal Police to request registration in the National Registry of Refugees. This
                            registration is necessary to prove refugee status and obtain proper documentation.</li>
                        <li>Personal documentation: Refugees must provide the required personal documents for issuing
                            the SUS Card, such as the RNE (National Registry of Foreigners), passport, or Refugee
                            Application Protocol. Additionally, other documents may be requested, such as proof of
                            residence and CPF (Individual Taxpayer Identification).</li>
                        <li>Visit a SUS healthcare facility: With the necessary documents in hand, the refugee should go
                            to a SUS healthcare facility, such as a primary healthcare unit, hospital, or service
                            center. It is important to choose a facility near their place of residence.</li>
                        <li>Request the SUS Card: At the facility, the refugee should inform that they wish to obtain
                            the SUS Card. They will need to fill out a form with personal information and provide the
                            required documents. The attendant will guide them through the specific procedures for card
                            issuance at that facility.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        After the application process, the SUS Card will be issued and delivered to the refugee. With
                        the card in hand, they can use healthcare services provided by the SUS, such as consultations,
                        exams, medication, and emergency care.</p>

                    <p>
                        It is important to note that the process of obtaining the SUS Card may vary depending on the
                        location and specific policies of each municipality. Therefore, it is recommended to contact the
                        municipal health department in the region where the refugee is residing to obtain accurate
                        information about the procedures and required documents.</p>
