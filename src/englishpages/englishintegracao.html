                        <p class="mb-4">
                            In order to provide greater comfort and security for new people seeking to reside in Brazil,
                            the need for a series of rights and duties in the social sphere for these immigrants was
                            created.

                            Here we gather the main laws and rights that assist immigrants during their period of
                            adaptation
                            or in times of greater need.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="mb-4 mt-5">Main Needs</em></h3>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            The needs for social integration of immigrants may vary depending on the destination country
                            and the individual circumstances of each immigrant. However, some of the most common needs
                            include:<br>
                            <br>
                            1. Learning the local language: the ability to communicate effectively in a
                            new environment is essential to integrate into local society and find work.
                            <br>
                            2. Knowledge of laws and social norms: immigrants need to understand the laws, norms, and
                            values of the society in which they are inserted in order to adapt and avoid conflicts.
                            <br>
                            3. Education and training: access to education and training can help immigrants
                            acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to secure employment and succeed professionally.
                            <br>
                            4. Support networks: building social and support networks is important for
                            immigrants to feel included and supported, whether through community groups, religious
                            organizations, or other informal networks.
                            <br>
                            5. Access to public services: access to public services, such as healthcare and social
                            assistance,
                            is essential to ensure that immigrants have an adequate quality of life.
                            <br>
                            6. Respect for the culture of origin: immigrants should be respected in relation to
                            their cultural backgrounds and traditions, without discrimination or prejudice.
                            <br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            7. Employment and job opportunities: access to job opportunities is crucial for
                            immigrants to sustain themselves and contribute to the local economy. This can also help
                            them
                            feel valued and included in society.
                            <br>
                            8. Access to adequate housing: a safe and suitable place to live is essential
                            for the stability and well-being of immigrants, as well as for their integration into the
                            community.
                            <br>
                            9. Access to translation and interpretation services: many immigrants
                            may face language barriers, making it difficult to access essential services. Translation
                            and
                            interpretation services can help overcome these barriers.
                            <br>
                            10. Civic participation: immigrants should have opportunities to participate
                            in the civic and political life of their community, whether through voting, involvement in
                            local
                            organizations, or exercising freedom of expression.
                            <br>
                            11. Security and Protection: Immigrants should have access to legal protection and personal
                            security to ensure they are treated with fairness and equality and are not victims of
                            discrimination or violence.

                            By providing support in these areas, immigrants can feel more comfortable and confident in
                            their
                            new communities, which can lead to better social and economic integration.

                        <p class="mb-4">
                            Located in various regions of the country, NGOs that seek to welcome and provide support for
                            immigrants are a valuable resource for encouraging their stay and improving their experience

                        <p class="mb-4">
                            With the increasing migration to Brazil, the country has been seeking more means to ensure
                            the
                            social integration of immigrants. For this purpose, several laws and policies have been
                            established to facilitate immigrants' access to public services, protect their rights, and
                            ensure their inclusion in Brazilian society.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            The Foreigners Statute, a law that establishes the rules for the entry, stay, and exit of
                            foreigners in the country, provides rights and obligations for immigrants during their stay
                            in
                            Brazil. The National Immigration Policy, launched in 2017, aims to guarantee the protection
                            of
                            immigrants' rights in Brazil, promote their social and economic integration, and strengthen
                            cooperation with other countries.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            In addition, the National Policies for Immigrants Plan, launched in 2014, seeks to ensure

                            integration of immigrants in areas such as education, health, work, and social assistance.
                            The
                            Migration Law, approved in 2017, establishes new rules for the entry and stay of immigrants
                            in
                            the country, including facilitating access to documentation and public services for

                            may require additional documentation for refugees, such as the Temporary Protocol of Refugee

                            Additionally, some Brazilian states and municipalities have specific healthcare programs for

                        <p>
                            Immigrants and their children have the right to access education in Brazil, whether in early
                            childhood education, elementary school, or high school. To enroll in a Brazilian public
                            school,
                            immigrants must follow the same procedures as Brazilians.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            The first step is to find a school near the immigrant's residence. Enrollment should be done
                            at
                            the Education Department of the state or municipality where the school is located. It is
                            important to have the necessary documentation on hand, such as proof of residence,
                            identification card, birth or marriage certificate, and school records (if applicable).
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            Some schools may require specific documentation for immigrants, such as the Temporary
                            Protocol
                            of Refugee Application (PPSR), the National Migration Registry Card (CRNM), or the Reception
                            Declaration from the Interiorization Program. However, in general, Brazilian public schools
                            accept the passport or equivalent document from the country of origin as identification.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            Once enrolled in school, the student is entitled to all the services offered, such as school
                            meals, educational materials, and extracurricular activities. If the student does not speak
                            Portuguese, the school should provide Portuguese language teachers as a second language to
                            facilitate their adaptation.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            It is worth noting that education is a fundamental human right, and immigrants have the
                            right to
                            receive it in a dignified manner and without discrimination. Brazilian schools have the duty
                            to
                            promote the inclusion of immigrant students, respecting their culture and providing them
                            with a
                            welcoming and egalitarian environment.
